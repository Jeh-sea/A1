        The jaguar is a large, muscular cat native to the Americas and is known for its spotted coat and powerful build. 
        As the third-largest big cat in the world, it is an apex predator, preying on deer, birds, and even caimans. 
        Jaguars are incredibly territorial and are often found in rainforests, swamps, and grasslands. 
        While jaguars can be housed in zoos, their need for large territories and specific habitats makes replicating their natural environment a challenge.
