      The hawk is a bird of prey known for its sharp vision, powerful talons, and swift flight. 
      Found in diverse habitats worldwide, hawks are skilled hunters, feeding on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. 
      Their keen eyesight allows them to spot prey from far away, making them efficient predators. 
      Because of their wild nature and need for open spaces, it make them unsuitable for traditional zoo environments.
