        The great white shark is a powerful apex predator and when it reaches adulthood it can easily be up to 20 feet in length and weighing over 5,000 pounds. 
        Known for its speed, sharp teeth, and keen senses, it hunts marine mammals, fish, and seabirds. 
        This shark plays a vital role in ocean ecosystems but cannot be kept in zoos due to its massive size, need for vast open waters, and constant movement to breathe, making captivity unsuitable.
        (Since this is a virtual Zoo, we can show you a picture of a great white shark!)
