        The blobfish is a deep-sea fish known for its gelatinous, droopy appearance, often called the "world's ugliest animal."
        Found in depths up to 4,000 feet off Australia and New Zealand, its soft body has adapted to high-pressure environments.
        The blobfish feeds on small invertebrates and waste but cannot survive in zoos due to its specialized deep-sea habitat.
